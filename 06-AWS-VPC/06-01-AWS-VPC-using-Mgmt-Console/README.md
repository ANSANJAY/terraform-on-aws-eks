- Click on **Create Internet Gateway**
- Click on Actions -> Attach to VPC -> my-manual-vpc

## Step-05: Create NAT Gateway
- **Name:** my-nat-gateway
- **Subnet:** my-public-subnet-1

- Click on **Create NAT Gateway**

## Step-06: Create Public Route Table and Create Routes and Associate Subnets
### Step-06-01: Create Public Route Table
- **Name tag:** my-public-route-table
- **vpc:** my-manual-vpc
- Click on **Create**
### Step-06-02: Create Public Route in newly created Route Table
- Click on **Add Route**
- **Destination:** 0.0.0.0/0
- **Target:** my-igw
- Click on **Save Route**
### Step-06-03: Associate Public Subnet 1 in Route Table
- Click on **Edit Subnet Associations**
- Select **my-public-subnet-1**
- Click on **Save**


## Step-07: Create Private Route Table and Create Routes and Associate Subnets
### Step-07-01: Create Private Route Table

Got it! Let’s build a memory aid + visual breakdown to help you **remember the entire VPC creation process** — whether you're doing it manually, through the AWS Console, or with Terraform.

---

## 🧠 **Memory Aid: "VPC SPIN RODE NAT"**

Think of the VPC setup like spinning a wheel to "RODE NAT" (like *rode a bike* 🛞) — it's catchy, and each letter stands for a key step in the VPC build.

```
VPC SPIN → base infrastructure  
RODE NAT → services & routing
```

### 🗂️ Terraform Perspective: Ordered Resource Types

```hcl
# 1. VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {}

# 2. Subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public" {}
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {}

# 3. Internet Gateway
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {}

# 4. Route Tables
resource "aws_route_table" "public" {}
resource "aws_route_table" "private" {}

# 5. Route Table Associations
resource "aws_route_table_association" {}

# 6. NAT Gateway + Elastic IP
resource "aws_eip" "nat" {}
resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat" {}

# 7. Security Groups
resource "aws_security_group" "public_sg" {}

# 8. EC2, RDS, etc.
resource "aws_instance" "web" {}
resource "aws_db_instance" "db" {}
```

Perfect! Now that you know each component deeply, let’s build a **smooth, interview-friendly flow** to help you **confidently explain how you created a VPC** — like a story, but structured enough to impress a technical panel.

---

## 🎙️ How to Explain VPC Creation in an Interview — Ideal Flow

### 🔰 **1. Start with the Why**

> “To isolate and securely manage our resources, I created a VPC with both public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.”

This shows intention and architecture awareness.

---

### 🧱 **2. Define the Network Boundary (VPC + CIDR Block)**

> “I started by creating a VPC with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`, giving me enough IP space to create multiple subnets.”

🔹 Shows you understand IP planning.

---

### 🏙️ **3. Subnet Planning (Public + Private in Multiple AZs)**

> “Next, I divided the VPC into subnets. For high availability, I created public and private subnets in at least two Availability Zones — for example, `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`.”

* Public subnet for NAT, Load Balancer, Bastion
* Private subnet for EC2 (app)
* Private DB subnet (optional, isolated)

---

### 🌐 **4. Internet Gateway for Public Subnets**

> “To allow internet access to public subnets, I attached an Internet Gateway to the VPC and updated the public route table to forward 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to it.”

* Use this to explain internet-bound traffic setup.

---

### 🛰️ **5. NAT Gateway for Private Subnets**

> “For private subnets to initiate outbound internet requests securely, I deployed a NAT Gateway in each public subnet and attached an Elastic IP to it.”

* Adds depth and shows security best practices.

---

### 🛣️ **6. Route Tables and Associations**

> “I created separate route tables — one for public subnets (with route to IGW) and another for private subnets (with route to NAT Gateway). Then I associated each subnet with the appropriate route table.”

* Confirms understanding of traffic flow.

---

### 🧯 **7. Security Groups for Resource Protection**

> “I used security groups to control access — for example, SSH and HTTP for EC2 in public subnets, and only internal communication for instances in private subnets.”

* Optional: “I used NACLs for subnet-level restrictions in some environments.”

---

### 🏗️ **8. Resource Deployment**

> “Once the network layer was ready, I launched EC2 instances into private subnets, attached IAM roles, added user-data scripts, and verified outbound access via the NAT Gateway.”

* You can tailor this to EC2, RDS, ALB, etc.

---

### 🧪 **9. Validation and Testing**

> “I tested connectivity using curl and ping, verified route propagation, and ensured that private instances couldn’t be accessed from outside, but could reach the internet for updates.”

* Shows responsibility for security and correctness.

---

### 🧹 **10. Clean-Up (Optional Ending)**

> “I followed Terraform best practices by managing everything as code and ensured proper teardown using `terraform destroy` when the environment was no longer needed.”

---

## 🧠 Bonus: One-Liner Summary (To Close Your Answer)

> “In short, I built a production-grade VPC with public and private subnets across AZs, used NAT for secure internet access, applied route tables for traffic control, and used security groups for fine-grained access.”
